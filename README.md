# Radix Biblio

Radix Bilbio is a collection of the most fundamental texts for building, curated by _successful_ _builders_. 

A _builder_ is a person who attempts to build something as opposed to critisizing, editing, or optimizing. Common examples are entrepreneurs, technologists, scientists, mathematicians, writers, and musicians.

A _successful builder_ has built what they set out to build. Most builders fail, and therefore are not qualified to comment on how to build successfully.
